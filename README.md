# Hendrix Cat Collector

A Flutter Demo project.

This app is intended for Hendrix students to keep track of the cats they see on campus.

It allows them to add locations and cats while they're out on a cat hunt!

This project helped me learn the basics of Flutter and Dart, and now I can start making more complicated apps in the future.
